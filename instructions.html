Instructions
<ol style="width: 300px">
	<li>This game plays just like the game Othello, with minor exceptions.</li>
	<li>There is a black player and white player.  Black moves first.</li>
	<li>A legal move is a move adjacent to the current pieces, 
	where your piece forms a sandwich with your opponents color vertically, horizontally, and/or diagonally.</li>
	<li>The inbetween pieces are flipped over to your color.  
	The score is based on how many of the current pieces are your own color.</li>
	<li>The next player moves (the players turn is indicated under the scorecard).</li>
	<li>If a player can't move legally, or chooses not to, they can skip there turn.
		If both players pass in subsequent turns, the game ends (it's an honors system to keep going).</li>
	<li>If the board fills to entirety, or step 6 occurs, the game ends and whoever has the most pieces wins.
	If the score is equal, it ends in a tie.</li>
	<li>Hit new game to start over.  Can be done anytime in the game.</li>
</ol>
